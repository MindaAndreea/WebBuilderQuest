          <h3>HTML Basics</h3>
          <p>
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it forms the backbone
            of web development. It defines the structure and content of web
            pages using a markup system with tags.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML documents are composed of elements structured using tags. Tags
            are enclosed in angle brackets < > and define different parts of a
            web page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are headings from h1 to h6 and they keep decreasing in
            font-size. Usually the pages have only one h1.
          </p>

          <h3>Tips for Success:</h3>
          <p>
            Use Proper Nesting: Ensure tags are properly nested within each
            other head inside html, title inside head, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Validate Your Code: Use online validators to check your HTML for

          <h3>Lists and Links:</h3>
          <p>
            Lists and Links are other HTML elements. There are two types of
            lists: ordered lists and unordered lists. The ordered lists are
            displayed with numbers usually. The unordered lists are used when
            the sequence of items does not matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The links (or hyperlinks) are used to link to other web pages,
            files, locations within the same page, email addresses or any URL.
          </p>
          <h3>Exercise Overview:</h3>

          <p>
            Forms in HTML provide a powerful way to collect user input and
            interact with visitors to your website. They allow users to input
            data, which can be submitted to a server for processing or used
            locally within the webpage. HTML provides various input elements
            that cater to different types of user input, such as text,
            passwords, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown lists, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the "Forms and Inputs" section, you'll explore how to create
            interactive forms using HTML. Here's what you will learn:
          </p>
          <p>
            Basic structure for forms and inputs. Each input element is defined
            using specific tags input, textarea, select and attributes to
            control its behavior.
          </p>
          <p>Text Input: Allows users to enter single-line text.</p>
          <p>
            Password Input: Similar to text input but obscures characters for
            security.
          </p>
          <p>
            Radio Checkbox: Provides a checkbox that users can check or uncheck.
          </p>
          <p>
            Buttons: Allows users to select only one option from a group of
            options.

          <p>
            Images play a crucial role in web design, enhancing visual appeal
            and conveying information effectively. In HTML, the img tag is used
            to embed images into web pages. Additionally, providing descriptive
            alternative text (alt text) for images is essential for
            accessibility, allowing screen readers to describe images to users
            who are visually impaired.

            ensure your content is accessible to all users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Validation: Validate your HTML to ensure proper usage of image tags
            and alt attributes.
          </p>
          <p>
            SEO: Alt text also benefits SEO (Search Engine Optimization) by
            providing context to search engines about the content of the image.
          </p>

            Tables in HTML are used to organize and display data in rows and
            columns. They are particularly useful for presenting information in
            a structured format, such as schedules, pricing lists, and
            comparison charts. Understanding how to create and structure tables

          <h3>Semantic HTML:</h3>
          <p>
            Semantic HTML involves using HTML5 elements that provide meaning to
            the structure and content of web pages. These elements help to
            create a clear and logical document structure, improving both
            accessibility and SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Semantic tags
            clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way,
            making it easier for browsers, search engines, and assistive
            technologies to interpret the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Semantic HTML introduces elements that convey meaning about the
            content they contain, rather than just how they should appear.
            Examples: header, nav, section, article, aside, footer.
          </p>
          <p>
            header: Represents introductory content, typically a group of
            introductory or navigational aids.
          </p>
          <p>
            nav: Represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to
            parts within the page—a section with navigation links.
          </p>
          <p>
            section: Represents a standalone section of content, which can have
            a heading.
          </p>
          <p>
            article: Represents a self-contained composition in a document,
            page, application, or site, intended to be independently
            distributable or reusable.
          </p>
          <p>
            aside: Represents a portion of a document whose content is only
            indirectly related to the document's main content.
          </p>
          <p>
            footer: Represents the footer for its nearest sectioning content or
            sectioning root element.

        </div>
        <div class="level-six-content">

          <h3>Basic Styling:</h3>
          <p>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages.
            It controls the color, font, spacing, and overall visual
            presentation of HTML elements. Understanding basic CSS styling is
            essential for creating visually appealing web pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is CSS? CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It describes how
            HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other
            media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basic Syntax: CSS is composed of selectors and declarations. A
            declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by
            semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a
            value, separated by a colon.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS Selectors: Element Selector: Targets HTML elements directly
            (e.g., h1, p). Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific
            class attribute (e.g., .className). ID Selector: Targets an element
            with a specific ID attribute (e.g., #idName).
          </p>
          <p>
            Basic Properties: Color: Changes the text color. Font: Sets the font
            family, size, weight, and style. Background: Sets the background
            color or image. Borders: Adds borders around elements. Margin and
            Padding: Controls the spacing outside and inside elements,
            respectively.

          <h3>Exercise Overview:</h3>
          <p>
            You need to create an HTML document with a section that contains a
            heading, 2 paragraphs and 1 table with how many rows and columns
            you'd like. In the CSS file you need to change the background-color
            of the section, the color of the heading and the font-size. Choose
            two different background-colors for the paragraphs and add borders
            to the table.
          </p>
          <p>You may choose the content.</p>
          <h3>Tips for Success:</h3>
          <p>Consistency: Keep your CSS organized and consistent.</p>
          <p>
            Experiment: Try different properties and values to see their
            effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Validation: Use CSS validators to check for errors and best
            practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Practice: The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become
