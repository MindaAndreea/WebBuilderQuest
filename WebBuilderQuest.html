          <h3>HTML Basics</h3>
          <p>
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it forms the backbone
            of web development. It defines the structure and content of web
            pages using a markup system with tags.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML documents are composed of elements structured using tags. Tags
            are enclosed in angle brackets < > and define different parts of a
            web page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are headings from h1 to h6 and they keep decreasing in
            font-size. Usually the pages have only one h1.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="level-one-content">
          <h3>Exercise Overview:</h3>
          <p>
            In this exercise you will create a basic HTML Document that includes
            one main heading, one subheading and a few paragraphs.
          </p>
          <p>You may choose the content.</p>
          <p>By completing this exercise, you will:</p>
          <p>Understand the basic structure of an HTML document.</p>
          <p>Gain familiarity with common HTML tags and their usage.</p>
          <p>Learn how to create content hierarchy using headings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="level-one-tips">
          <h3>Tips for Success:</h3>
          <p>
            Use Proper Nesting: Ensure tags are properly nested within each
            other head inside html, title inside head, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Validate Your Code: Use online validators to check your HTML for
            syntax errors and compliance with standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Experiment: Don't hesitate to experiment with different tags and
            attributes to understand their behavior and use cases better.
